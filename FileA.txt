Welcome to The Trail. This is an interactive game set in 1917. Congress has just passed the selective service act. President Wilson's proclamation forces abled bodied men to report to Fort Worth, Texas as soon as possible. The reason for the Selective Service Act, though, was that American men had not volunteered en masse or certainly not in the numbers needed to raise, train, and deploy an army quickly after the United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917. 
Your goal as the player is to safely get as many of the 3 players to Fort Worth as possible in 12 days. Along the way you can adjust pace and rations. You will also have the ability to have the group rest for a certain amount of days. Be careful and may the odds be in your favor!

Now you will choose the names of your players as well as their job. Each job has certain advantges. Doctors will start the game with more health, farmers with more hunger, and hunters with more ammunition.


This is the shop. Here you will decide what to purchase for your journey. You will be able to access the shop only once on your journey. The total journey is 145 miles. You are in charge of keeping the players alive by adjusting pace and rations. Hunting is also availible at every 10 mile checkpoint. 


Now we will begin the journey! We will begin from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
